This is the coding test for a contract at AIA.

The code is functionally complete, but some of it isn't as pretty as I'd have liked. I've been constrained by a lack of a reliable Internet connection at my temporary digs! (I've been working out of Benalla library and Macca's for their free WiFi!)

If I had more time, I'd have done the image list as a RecyclerView, and probably backed it up with the MVVM pattern. But I wanted to get it going in an hour or two, so went with the simpler (but less efficient) ListView.

I've added a few unit tests, more to prove that I know how to do them. Coverage isn't great, though.
